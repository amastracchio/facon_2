updater version 1.23 from facon 1.0.13a
usage: updater [options] collector
where options are:
  -d nnn  enable debugging output at level 'nnn'
  -f fff  use 'fff' for config-dir [/root/3p/facon/etc/config]
  -h      show this help
  -H hhh  only process host 'hhh'
  -r rrr  update rrd file 'rrr' (see note1)
  -R RRR  update only rrd 'RRR'

Note1: The -r option must be combined with the -H and -R options and is
intended only to be used by rt-updater.  It will take data only for the
specified host (-H) and RRD (-R) and update the specified (-r) RRD file,
instead of the usual calculated one.

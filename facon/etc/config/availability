# availability - defining what it means for a variable to be "available"
# $Id: availability,v 1.8 2003/05/09 20:05:13 facon Exp $

# There are two types of availability definitions: for an RRD or for an 
# RRD on a particular host.  The RRD may also be a wildcard RRD, like
# "df-*" or an instance of an RRD, like "df-/home".  The definitions
# look like:
#
#	rrd RRDNAME VARNAME CF RELATION THRESHOLD
# and
#	host HOSTNAME RRDNAME VARNAME CF RELATION THRESHOLD
#
# The CF is one of LAST, MIN, MAX or AVERAGE, with rrdtool's usual
# meaning.  The RELATION can be any one of: <, <=, >, >=, or =.  
# The THRESHOLD is the number which the value of VARNAME must be 
# in the correct RELATION.  (Clear as mud.)  
#
# As an example, take the following definition:
#
#	rrd ping rcvd > 0
#
# This means that the variable 'ping' must be greater than zero for it
# to be considered "available".  All time intervals where it isn't, or
# for which no data is available, are considered "unavailable".
#
# There are also two other record types: colors and thresholds.  A colors
# record looks like:
#
#	colors COLOR1 ...
#
# A thresholds line looks like:
#
#	thresholds NUMBER ...
#
# and must have the same number of values as the colors line.  Only one of
# each.  Here's an example to make the use clear (I hope):
#
#	colors avail1 avail2 avail3 avail4
#	thresholds 99 98 95 90
#
# The colors line requires that the colors 'avail1', ... be defined in the
# colors config-file.  The thresholds line specifies that if an availability
# is 99% or above, it should be colored 'avail1' color, 98% or above, use
# 'avail2' color, etc.

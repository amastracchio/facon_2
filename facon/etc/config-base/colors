# These aren't magic, but the default graph definitions 
# expect them to exist, so make sure you change them 
# here and there, if you do change them.

# These are used for graphing how much of something is used,
# e.g. disk space.  The totalcolor is used to graph the total
# amount (e.g. disk size) as an AREA, and the usedcolor is
# used to graph how much is used, as a LINE2.
totalcolor	00a000
usedcolor	a00000

# The downcolor is used to color the background of the
# ping thumbnail graphs on the ping-index.
downcolor	a07777

# This is for making missing data more noticable, without hiding everything
missing		dddddd
# This is for shading behind error conditions

# Problemcolor is used for graphing things which are 
# expected to be zero and are alarming when they're not.
problemcolor ff0000

# The linecolor is used to draw a horizontal line at T1
# level of bps (bits-per-second) on the interface bps
# graphs.
linecolor	000000

# These are used to draw the good-old interface graphs,
# both bps and pps.

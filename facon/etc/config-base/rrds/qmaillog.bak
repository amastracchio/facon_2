# rrds/qmaillog - byte, message and delivery counts for qmail
# CVS $Id: qmaillog,v 1.10 2003/03/20 18:09:45 remstats Exp $
# from remstats version 1.0.13a
# Copyright 2003 by Thomas Erskine <terskine@users.sourceforge.net>

# This is only useful if you're running qmail.  It will show new message
# count, message bytes, number of deliveries attempted, and how they fared,
# and the max concurrency during each period, local and remote.

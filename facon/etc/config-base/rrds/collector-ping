graph	entries-ping desc="This is collected by the ping-collector.  This shows the efficiency of the collector.  Requests are how many requests(lines) that the collector sent to the server.  Collected is how many responses (lines) were returned.  Used is how many of those lines were used.  Ideally, Collected should be at least as large as Requests, or some requests are not being answered.  If Used is larger than Collected, then some responses are being ignored.  The numbers here are not interesting; the pattern is.  Unexplained anomalies usually indicate a problem."

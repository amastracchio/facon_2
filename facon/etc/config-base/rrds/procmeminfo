graph	memory desc="This is collected by the unix-status-collector.  It is Linux specific.  It works by reading and parsing /proc/meminfo.  Total memory is how much memory exists on the host.  Free Memory is not being used at all, and is often very low on a busy machine with no adverse effects.  Shared is memory which is shared between programs, e.g. for shared libraries.  Buffers is memory used by the file-system for transferring to and from disk.  Cache is any of the above which isn't being used right now, but is clean and could be used instead of reading something off the disk.  The Free Memory can be and often is very low because the memory is shared between programs and file-system bufers, so any Free memory quickly gets sucked into the file-system buffers.  It will be freed for use by any program which needs it."

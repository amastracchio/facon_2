Here we have the temperature related numbers for Ottawa.  Humidex is a pseudo-temperature telling how hot it feels, taking humidity into account.  The Dewpoint is the temperature at which the current humidity would saturate the air and begin to condense.  I.E. when it would begin to precipitate.  In this example, you would have to change the associated script to change which city we are getting data for.'

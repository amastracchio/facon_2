# rrds/snmp-routes-* - route counts by BGP peer

# Unfortunately, it doesn't scale to Internet size routing tables.  
# I estimate that our Internet router at CRC, with 2 peers (full Internet
# routing table from each), would take about 45 minutes to fetch 
# this information.  It may be useful to someone else with smaller requirements

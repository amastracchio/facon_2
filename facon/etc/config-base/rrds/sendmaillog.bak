# rrds/sendmaillog - message, byte and delivery counts for sendmail

#
# This is only useful if you're running sendmail.  It will count the new
# messages and message bytes and the deliveries attempted and how they fared.
# I need some data to improve the patterns for delfail and deldefer.  Send me
# lines from the log which were defered and failed, different kinds if there
# is more than one kind of message.

It works by connecting to the log-server running on the host and requesting it to get information about new records on the log-files that it has been told to serve.  In this case, it reads from a standard web-server log-file and counts the number of requests and successful requests, as determined by the HTTP response code.  I.E. if it begins with a 2, it is considered to be successful"

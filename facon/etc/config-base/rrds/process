graph	process desc="This is collected by the unix-status-collector.  (Under Solaris, look at the wait graphs for swapping problems.)  It works by running the <B>vmstat</B> command on the remote host and parsing the output to look for the Free Memory.  Exactly what Free Memory is depends on the flavour of unix.  Under Linux, free memory can be near zero with no apparent ill effects, as it uses all of memory shared between running programs and file-system buffers."

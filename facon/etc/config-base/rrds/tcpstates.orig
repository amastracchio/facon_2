graph	tcpstates	desc="This is collected by the unix-status-collector.  It works by running the <B>netstat</B> program on the remote host and parsing the output.  Here it counts the number of different TCP sessions in the different TCP states.  The various XXX_WAIT states should be of short duration so there should not be many sessions in those states.  You may have to tweak the alert numbers on a busy server."

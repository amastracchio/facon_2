graph	uptime desc="This is collected by the snmp-collector.  It works by sending an SNMP query to the host for certain RRD-specified OIDs.  The OID in question should be implemented in any SNMP implementation.  Note that it is only telling the time since the SNMP software started.  In a hardware implementation, it usually does mean how long the equipment has been up, but in host SNMP software, the distinction between SNMP uptime and host uptime must be remembered."

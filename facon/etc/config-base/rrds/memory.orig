graph	memory desc="This is collected by the unix-status-collector.  (Under Solaris, look at the scanrate graphs for swapping problems.)  It works by running the <B>vmstat</B> command on the remote host and parsing the output to look for the Free Memory.  Exactly what Free Memory is depends on the flavour of unix.  Under Linux, free memory can be near zero with no apparent ill effects, as it uses all of memory shared between running programs and file-system buffers."

graph	scanrate desc="This is collected by the unix-status-collector.  It works by running the <B>vmstat</B> program on the remote host and parsing the output.  The scanrate is zero except when the system needs more memory and can't find enough by paging-out inactive pages.  If it's non-zero, then active processes had to be swapped out.  If it's happening on a regular basis, then you need more memory (or fewer/smaller programs).  This is only available under Solaris."

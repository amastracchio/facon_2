The battery temperature measured by UPS ##HOST##(##IP##) is now ##VALUE## degrees.
This is too high and needs to be looked into.  The UPS will shutdown around 
60 degrees Celcius or 140 Fahrenheit.

Also note that the temperature sensor on the batteries is not well calibrated
and can be quite inconsistent between UPSs.

[This is the default alert message for things which don't specify a
special template.]

       Host: ##HOST## ##HOSTDESC##
         IP: ##IP##
        RRD: ##REALRRD## ##RRDDESC##
   Variable: ##VAR##
      Value: ##VALUE##
   Relation: ##RELATION##
  Threshold: ##THRESHOLD##
      Start: ##START##
   Duration: ##DURATION##

Please fix it.

The status (##STATUS##) was defined in the alert definition for
this type of event.  This alert was triggered because the
variable (##VAR##) in the RRD-database (##REALRRD##) attained
the relation (##RELATION##) with the threshold (##THRESHOLD##).
This started at ##START## and has been in this state
for ##DURATION##.

This is the generic alert-template for network service response time for 
port ##WILDPART## on ##HOST##(##IP##).  The service took ##VALUE##ms to
respond which is ##RELATION## ##THRESHOLD##.

Exactly what it means depends on the probe scripts, but ERROR or 
CRITICAL usually mean that the service is unavailable and WARN 
usually means that service is degraded.
